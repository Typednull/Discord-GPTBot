# Discord-GPTBot
**This Does Not Work**

Making a discord bot with GPT-4o.

run: `python3 -m venv bot-env` in your custom directory to set up the environment
run these two commands after
`bot-env\Scripts\activate.bat`
`python -m src.discord_bot`

Really just a bunch of thrown together googled scripts and stuff. good luck
